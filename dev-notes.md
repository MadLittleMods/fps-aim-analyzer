## X11

In this project, we're using the [`zigx`](https://github.com/marler8997/zigx) project which is a pretty barebones wrapper around the X11 client protocol to communicate with the X11 server.

Documentation:

 - Protocol: https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html
 - `libx11` for C projects: https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html
